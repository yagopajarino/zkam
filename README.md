## Project Overview

Have you ever looked at a photo and wondered: **Is it a zkam?** ðŸ›¸ðŸ˜±

Introducing zkam, the photo authentication app that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure image ownership and integrity. With zkam, users can capture photos, automatically sign them with their unique digital signature, and verify ownership without compromising privacy. Our seamless process encrypts signature data directly into the image, generates a secure hash, and creates a zero-knowledge proofâ€”all while maintaining the user's anonymity.

Whether you're a photographer protecting your work, a journalist verifying sources, or anyone concerned about image authenticity in the digital age, zkam provides a powerful, user-friendly solution for proving photo ownership and authenticity without revealing sensitive information.

## How does it work?

We use [steganography](https://github.com/NicolasBiondini/steganography-project/tree/main) to embed the hash of the original image into our `zkam-proof` image, allowing the user to verify the authenticity of the captured photo.

Our procedure works as follows:
- The user takes a photo with our app.
- With the user's private key, a pseudo-random set of bytes is selected from the photo.
- These byte locations are used to store the hash of their complement in the original image.
- Only the user has the key to reveal the hash stored secretly in the image.
- The user can provide a zero-knowledge proof that the hash stored in the secret bytes coincides with the hash of their complement in the image, thus proving that the image has not been altered.

## About

`zkam` is an open-source project developed by [NicolÃ¡s Biondini](https://github.com/NicolasBiondini), [Yago PajariÃ±o](https://github.com/yagopajarino), [Alejandro Almaraz](https://github.com/almaraz97), and [Arturo Beccar-Varela](https://github.com/arturoBeccar). With backgrounds in computer science, math, and blockchain, we are interested in the applications of zero-knowledge proofs to privacy and authentication.

## Acknowledgements

`zkam` was initially developed as part of the ZK/Privacy Track of the [Level Up Hackathon in Buenos Aires, 2024](https://taikai.network/ethargentina/hackathons/level-up-argentina-2024). We attended this hackathon as part of our participation in the [PSE Core Program](https://pse.dev/en/programs), a six-week program focused on learning the fundamentals and latest developments in programmable cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and more.
